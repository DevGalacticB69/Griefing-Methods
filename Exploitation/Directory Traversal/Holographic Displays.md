# Holographic Displays Plugin Directory Traversal Exploit

### Overview
Holographic Displays is a plugin designed to create holograms on servers. With a feature in the plugin, you can read files from the FTP server.

### Analysis
A feature in the plugin makes you able to read and display files as a hologram on the server. In the version 2.3.9 of Holographic Displays and below, you can use `../` in the command argument to go back in directories. This means you can read any file on the server.

The start directory is in the Holographic Displays plugin folder located at `./plugins/Holographic Displays`. By using `../` one time, it will go back to the plugins folder located at `./plugins`. Add another `../` and you'll be in the default Minecraft server folder where all Bukkit files etc. are located.

### Exploiting
Using the command `/hd readtext <hologram name> <path>` will read the specific file and display it on the server as a hologram. E.g. `/hd readtext <hologram name> ../../server.properties` will display the server properties file as a hologram.

This exploit can be very neat to gather information, database credentials etc. from the server.

### Prevention
In the later updates of Holographic Displays, this vulnerability was patched. As long as you use the latest version of the plugin, you are protected from the exploit.

### Useful paths
- `../LiteBans/config.yml` will expose the LiteBans MySQL database server address and credentials
- `../../bukkit.yml` will expose the Bukkit MySQL database server address and credentials
- `../../server.properties` will expose the RCON port and password, if enabled on the server
