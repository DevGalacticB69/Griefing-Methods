# ServerSigns Plugin RFI Exploit

**Overview**

ServerSigns is a sign plugin used for server administrators to make signs execute an action when interacting with it.

With a potential bug in the plugin, you can read server files if you have the right permissions.

**Analysis**

With a feature in the plugin, you can create scripts for it. Using the administrator command `/svs import <script>` you can add a script to the specific sign. The potential bug in the plugin, is that you can use `../` to go back in directories. This doesn't seem like a problem, since you can't read the file content, right? Well, when you've imported any file from the server files e.g. `../../server.properties`, and then right clicking the sign, ServerSigns will return errors from each line of the file. In the error messages, you can see each line content, meaning you can see the whole files content.

The errors occurres, because the file cannot be executed as a ServerSigns script, as it's not a script.

**Exploiting**

First you create a new ServerSigns by placing a sign and then executing the command `/svs create` and then right clicking the sign. After that, you execute the following ommand `/svs import <file path>` and then right clicking the sign again.

In the chat, you'll see each line of the specified file.

**Prevention**

There hasn't really been a patch yet for this exploit. Just be careful who you're giving administrator permissions to, and protect your server from getting hacked by hackers, who can give themselves administrator privileges.
