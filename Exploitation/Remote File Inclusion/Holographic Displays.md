# Holographic Displays Plugin RFI Exploit

**Overview**

Holographic Displays is a plugin designed to create holograms on servers. With a feature in the plugin, you can read files from the FTP server.

**Analysis**

A feature in the plugin makes you able to read files and display them as a hologram on the server. In the version [version] and below, you can use `../` in the command to go back in directories. This means you can read any file on the server.

**Exploiting**

Using the command `/hd readfile <hologram name> <path>` will read the specific file and display it on the server. E.g. `/hd readfile <hologram name> ../../server.properties` will display the server properties file as a hologram.

This exploit can be very neat to gather information, database credentials etc. from the server.

**Useful paths**

- `../LiteBans/config.yml` will expose the LiteBans MySQL database server address and credentials
- `../../bukkit.yml` will expose the Bukkit MySQL database server address and credentials
- `../../server.properties` will expose the RCON port and password, if enabled on the server

**Prevention**

In the later updates of Holographic Displays, this vulnerability was patched. As long as you use the latest version of the plugin, you are protected from the exploit.
